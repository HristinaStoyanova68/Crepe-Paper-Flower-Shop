## Project Description

[HRISTINA'S CRAFT WORLD ReactJS](https://hristina-s-craft-world-reactjs.firebaseapp.com/) is an online platform that provides browsing opportunities for handcrafted products made from crepe paper. The platform offers the following functionalities:

- Users can explore a gallery consisting of three collections: bouquets, decorations for home or parties, and gift boxes adorned with crepe paper flowers.
- Initially, the platform showcases three products from each collection, accessible for viewing by all users.
- Registered users can sign in to the system and log in using their credentials.
- Upon successful registration, users are redirected to the login page and can log in with their created credentials.
- Once logged in, users can create new products using the "create" button.
- Created products can be edited or deleted by their owners, as well as liked by other users.
- Non-logged-in users can only view product details without access to edit or delete buttons or the ability to like products.
- Site navigation includes a logo that redirects to the homepage with a catalog displaying the three collections via a carousel.
- The top section of the page contains a "New Releases" navigation, showcasing the latest three products overall.
- In the top right corner of the page, there is a "Profile" navigation where users can view all products they have created.
- The bottom section of the page (footer) contains a link to the Home Page on the left side.
- The right side of the footer includes the "About Us" section, which upon clicking shows a brief description of HRISTINA'S CRAFT WORLD, followed by the "contact us" button leading to contact information.
